Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this AI Slop (yes, it was mostly vomited out by a large language model at 3 a.m.
while the human author was hyperfixating on DuckDB and forgetting to drink water—
classic Bangon Kali autism moment) to deal in the Slop without restriction,
including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Slop, and to permit persons
to whom the Slop is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included
   in all copies or substantial portions of the AI Slop.

2. You acknowledge that this is, in fact, AI Slop—gloriously unpolished,
   probably hallucinated in places, and lovingly stitched together by someone
   whose brain runs on a mix of caffeine, special interests, and sheer spite
   toward actually reading the official Capacitor docs.

3. No warranty is provided, express or implied. If the Slop sets your project
   on fire, makes your queries return rubber ducks instead of data, or causes
   unexpected existential dread about the nature of open-source in the age of
   generative AI, that’s between you, your therapist, and whatever deity you blame
   for letting Bangon Kali stay up past bedtime again.
